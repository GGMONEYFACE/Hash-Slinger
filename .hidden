I want to edit the source of rockyou from localhost to a github repository. How would I edit this line of code:

def pick_randomLine():
    with open('/home/kali/Downloads/rockyou.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as passwordList:
        lines = passwordList.readlines()
        return random.choice(lines).strip()

to use this url:

https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt
ChatGPT said:
To use a file from a GitHub URL instead of your local filesystem, you’ll need to download the content from the URL at runtime, instead of using open() for a local file.

Here’s how you can update your function using the requests library:

✅ Updated Code:
import random
import requests

def pick_randomLine():
    url = 'https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt'
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        lines = response.text.splitlines()
        return random.choice(lines).strip()
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to download file. Status code: {response.status_code}")
⚠️ Requirements:
Make sure the requests module is installed. If it's not, install it using:

pip install requests
⚡ Why stream=True?
It's generally used to download large files efficiently, but since you're reading all lines into memory with .splitlines(), it’s optional here. You can remove stream=True if memory is not a concern.

🧠 Note:
This downloads the entire wordlist each time the function runs, which may be slow and inefficient for large files like rockyou.txt.

🚀 Better Alternative (One-Time Download):
Instead of downloading every time, you could download the file once, save it locally, and then read from the local file like your original function:

import os
import random
import requests

ROCKYOU_PATH = 'rockyou.txt'
ROCKYOU_URL = 'https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt'

def download_rockyou():
    if not os.path.exists(ROCKYOU_PATH):
        print("Downloading rockyou.txt...")
        response = requests.get(ROCKYOU_URL)
        with open(ROCKYOU_PATH, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        print("Download complete.")

def pick_randomLine():
    download_rockyou()
    with open(ROCKYOU_PATH, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as passwordList:
        lines = passwordList.readlines()
        return random.choice(lines).strip()
Let me know which version works best for your needs, or if you want to optimize for performance or memory usage!

how do I create a new folder in a github repo
ChatGPT said:
Creating a new folder in a GitHub repository can be done directly through the GitHub web interface or via Git on your local machine. Here’s how to do both:

✅ Method 1: Using GitHub Website (Web UI)
📌 Steps:
Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click the "Add file" button near the top-right.

Choose "Create new file".

In the filename field, type your folder name followed by a /, then a filename (e.g.):

my_new_folder/README.md
GitHub doesn’t allow completely empty folders, so you must include at least one file.

Add some content to the file (even just a comment).

Scroll down, add a commit message, and click "Commit new file".

🎉 Now your folder my_new_folder/ exists in the repo!

✅ Method 2: Using Git (Locally on Your Machine)
📌 Steps:
Clone your repo (if you haven't already):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Create a new folder:

mkdir my_new_folder
Add a file to the folder (Git doesn’t track empty folders):

echo "# Placeholder" > my_new_folder/README.md
Stage and commit the change:

git add my_new_folder
git commit -m "Add new folder: my_new_folder"
git push origin main  # or your branch name
Let me know if you want to automate this or do it through the GitHub API instead.

How do I include the requests import in the GitHub?
ChatGPT said:
To include the requests import in a project you're pushing to GitHub, you simply need to:

✅ Step 1: Add import requests to your Python script
If your script uses the requests library, just make sure your .py file includes:

import requests
Then commit and push the file to your GitHub repo as usual.

✅ Step 2: Add requests to requirements.txt (recommended)
If you want others (or a deployment environment) to know which Python packages your project depends on, you should also create or update a requirements.txt file.

How to do that:
In your project folder (locally), run:

pip freeze > requirements.txt
Or manually create a file named requirements.txt with just:

requests
Add and push it to GitHub:

git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requests to requirements.txt"
git push origin main  # or your branch
✅ Step 3: Let users install dependencies
Then, anyone who clones your repo can install all dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
💡 Summary
Task	Purpose
import requests	Use the library in your code
requirements.txt	List dependencies for easy setup
pip install -r ...	Install all dependencies automatically
Let me know if you're using a virtual environment or need help setting one up.
